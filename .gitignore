## **Now Run Git Commands in Terminal (NOT in .gitignore!)**

The Git commands should be run in the **TERMINAL**, not pasted into any file!

1. **Open Terminal** in VS Code (View â†’ Terminal, or Ctrl + `)

2. **Make sure you're in the DevSync folder:**
```
   cd DevSync
```
   (If you're already there, skip this)

3. **Now run these commands ONE BY ONE in the terminal:**
```
   git init
```
   
   Then:
```
   git add .
```
   
   Then:
```
   git commit -m "Initial commit - DevSync MERN app"
```
   
   Then (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username):
```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DevSync.git
```
   
   Then:
```
   git branch -M main
```
   
   Finally:
```
   git push -u origin main
